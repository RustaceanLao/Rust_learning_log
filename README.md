## Rust_Learning_Log

Brief Introduction:

- For project: Open Source OS Training Camp 2022
- Contents: record daily learning for writing an OS in Rust

Before this training camp, I was doing:
- Reading:  [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)<p align="right">-- finished</p>
- Learning: [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com)<p align="right">-- doing</p>
- Learning: [toyDB: Distributed SQL database in Rust](https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb)<p align="right">-- doing</p>

I will record the learning for the two "doing" project in this log as well.
