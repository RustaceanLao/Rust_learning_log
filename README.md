## RustOS_learning_log

- For project: Open Source OS Training Camp 2022
- Contents: record daily learning for writing an OS in Rust

Before this training camp, I was doing:
- Reading: < The Rust Programming Language > from >https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/                      ****** finished
- Learning: < Writing an OS in Rust > from >https://os.phil-opp.com/                                           ****** doing
- Learning: < toyDB: Distributed SQL database in Rust > from >https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb            ****** doing

I will record the two "doing" learning in this log as well.
